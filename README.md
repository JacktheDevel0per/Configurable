# Configured



This mod allows you to toggle game mechanics with commands.


**I might change the config syntax in the future!**


By default vanilla mechanics are unchanged, the following commands can be used to customize the features of this mod:


Toggle the End dimension:
- `/config configured disableEnd set (true|false)`
Toggle End Gateway teleportation:
- `/config configured disableEndGateways set (true|false)`
Toggle Nether Portal travel:
- `/config configured disableNether set (true|false)`
